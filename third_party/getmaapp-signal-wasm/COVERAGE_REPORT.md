## Detailed Analysis

### ✅ Covered

All critical paths are now fully validated in `tests/web.rs`:

#### 1. Core Mechanics

- **Initialization**: `init()`, `SignalClient::new()`
- **Key Generation**: PreKeys, SignedPreKeys, KyberPreKeys
- **Session Management**: X3DH Handshake (`process_pre_key_bundle`)

#### 2. Messaging

- **1:1**: Encrypt/Decrypt (`encrypt_message`)
- **Groups**: Sender Key Distribution and Encryption

#### 3. Persistence (New)

- **Session Export/Import**: Verified by exporting Alice's session, verifying she can decrypt messages after `restore()`.
- **Identity Restoration**: Client recreation from keys and registration ID.

#### 4. Security Verification (New)

- **Safety Numbers**:
  - Verified `displayable` fingerprint matching between Alice and Bob.
  - Verified `verify_safety_number` API self-consistency.

#### 5. Private Groups (GV2) (New)

- **Master Key**: Generation and restoration from 32-byte arrays.
- **Derivation**: Deterministic derivation of 32-byte Group Identifiers and Secret Params from the Master Key.
- **Serialization**: Verified full persistence cycle for group secrets.

### ⚠️ Remaining Low Priority

- **Utilities**: `generate_random_bytes` is tested implicitly via key generation. Explicit unit tests for helpers are low priority.
- **Counter Invariants**: `get_next_pre_key_id` logic is exercised but not explicitly boundary tested.

## Conclusion

The library has achieved **Sufficient Coverage** for production usage, with all critical cryptographic operations and state management checks in place.
